## jc-cipher
`jc-cipher` is a simple tool to encode and decode your file.

## Installation
```
npm install -g jc-cipher
```

## Usage
### encoding file

```
jc-cipher encode <path-to-file> <key>
```

*Note*: `jc-cipher` don't save your key, so make sure you remember it or back it up some where for the decoding later.

The output will be localed in the same directory with the `path-to-file` with suffix `.encoded`
For example:
- input: `~./binh.txt`
- output: `~./binh.txt.encoded`

### decoding file

```
jc-cipher decode <path-to-encoded-file> <key>
```


The output will be localed in the same directory with the `path-to-encoded-file` with suffix `.decoded`
For example:
- input: `~./binh.txt.encoded`
- output: `~./binh.txt.encoded.decoded`
